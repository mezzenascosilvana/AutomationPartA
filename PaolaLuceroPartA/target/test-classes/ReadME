A)	Please create automated tests in TestNG Java (or Groovy) and Selenium 3 (WebDriver) with scenario given below. Test should be good for future maintenance (UI may be slightly changed) and runnable in Chrome and Firefox.

1.	Go to site http://www.expedia.com
2.	Select "Flights"
3.	Type London in "Fly from: city or airport"
4.	Select Heathrow in popup
5.	Type Dublin in "Flying to: city or airport"
6.	Select "Dublin Airport (DUB), Ireland" in popup
7.	Select Departing: 01/03/2019
8.	Select Departing: 07/03/2019
9.	Select 2 adults
10.	Click Search Button      
11.	Wait for all flights to be loaded. Find first row excluding the promotional row for “Flight + Hotel”                                                                   
12.	Assert Positive scenario that the price in first row is $123.45 (or any other price at your time)
13.	Assert Negative scenario that the price in first row is not $22.33
14.	Assert the visible left panel list of “Airlines included” below the list of “Stops”
15.	Scroll to the bottom of the page and assert the visibility of text “© 2018 Expedia, Inc. All rights reserved.”
Note: the assertion in point 12. and 13. is against the first available “Flight” price only, and not the first row that could contain “Flight + Hotel”, which does not contain a price on this webpage.
